# About
Reading Challenge is an application that lets users set a goal for reading number of books in a year, and adds books to the user's shelf, and keeps track of user's progress.  

Reading Challenge is  project that I built with React and Redux in the Front-end and with Ruby on Rails in the Back-end. This repository is the back-end of my application. The application was created using Create-React-App, and uses ES6 standards. 

# Install Directions
To see the application in browser, clone both back-end and front-end repositories. The front-end repository can be found here: https://github.com/Dillorom/reading-challenge-client. Run `db:migrate` and `rails s` in the  api folder in the terminal, and `npm install` and `npm start` in the client folder in the terminal. I will update this readme with an address once I deploy the application.
